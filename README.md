the freecell finds the solusion of the game freecell with one of the next algorithms: breadth-fs, depth-fs, best-fs, astar:

to run execute : freecell <method> <input-file> <output-file>
	where:
	<method> = breadth|depth|best|astar
	<input-file> is a file containing a Nx4 cards randomly and represent a random deal of cards in the game FreeCell .
	<output-file> is the file where the solution will be written.
